  "summary": "The diff implements all four requested requirements: rendering 17 store sectors with icons/names, displaying products within sectors with stock indicators, interactive sector selection with detail sheets, and visual representations of shelves/aisles/fixtures. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the implementation evidence.",

    {
      "description": "Asset loading system with multiple sprite/tileset images (tileset, departmentCounters, uiIcons, aisleShelves, floor, checkoutRegisters, customerSprites, employeeSprites)",
      "reason": "BuildRequest specifies 'Do not modify the existing customer simulation or animation logic' and mentions using 'canvas 2D context', but the extensive asset loading system with 8 different image assets was not requested. The requirements only asked for sector icons from sectorConstants.ts, not a full sprite/asset loading infrastructure.",
