  "summary": "The diff implements responsive layout updates for TitleScreen, ProfileSetupDialog, StoreInitializer, GameScene container sizing, a mobile-optimized HUD layout with larger tap targets, and a responsive GameCanvas with ResizeObserver sizing, clamped DPR, and a requestAnimationFrame render loop throttled for mobile performance. However, explicit mobile touch/gesture handling on the canvas to prevent page scrolling while interacting is not evidenced in the shown changes.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-43",
      "requirement": "Improve mobile input handling in the game view to avoid accidental browser gestures and provide predictable touch interactions (prevent unwanted page scroll while interacting with the game canvas; ensure UI remains scrollable where intended).",
      "reason": "In the provided GameCanvas.tsx snippet there is no shown application of touch-action / pointer event handling (e.g., setting CSS touch-action: none/manipulation on the canvas/container, or adding touchmove handlers with preventDefault) to prevent page scroll/bounce while interacting with the canvas. index.css defines a .touch-manipulation utility, but the diff evidence does not show it being applied to the game canvas/container.",
