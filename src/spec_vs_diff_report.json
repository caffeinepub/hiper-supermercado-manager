  "summary": "The implementation addresses all four requirements with comprehensive error handling, ErrorBoundary components, improved authentication flow, and graceful fallbacks for incomplete backend methods. The diff shows proper diagnosis and fixes for game loading issues through error boundaries, enhanced store initialization with error recovery, proper GameScene rendering checks, and improved backend actor initialization with authorization.",

      "reason": "REQ-1 requires fixing critical errors preventing game loading, but does not specify implementing a custom ErrorBoundary component with UI fallback. The requirement focuses on diagnosing and fixing the error, not adding error boundary infrastructure.",
