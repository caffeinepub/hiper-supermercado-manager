# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Transform the empty store floor grid into a realistic supermarket layout with visible sectors, shelves, aisles, and products.

**Planned changes:**
- Display all 17 store sectors (Produce, Butcher, Fish, Bakery, Dairy, Frozen, Beverages, Snacks, Canned, Cleaning, Personal Care, Baby, Pet, Electronics, Clothing, Home, Pharmacy) as labeled areas on the store floor with icons and names
- Render the 24 products from initialProducts.ts within their assigned sectors, showing product names and stock levels
- Add visual representation of shelves, aisles, refrigerators, freezers, and display fixtures to create a realistic supermarket layout
- Make sectors interactive: tapping/clicking a sector opens a detail view showing quality, stock value, staff, and cleanliness metrics

**User-visible outcome:** The store floor transforms from an empty grid into a detailed, interactive supermarket map where users can see all sectors, products on shelves, and tap any sector to view its performance metrics.
